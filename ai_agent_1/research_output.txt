Whale sharks are the largest species of fish in the world and belong to the carpet shark family, Rhincodontidae. They can grow up to 40 feet (12 meters) long, with reports of individuals exceeding 60 feet (18 meters). Whale sharks are known for their distinctive pattern of white spots and stripes on their dark gray bodies, which makes them easily recognizable. They primarily inhabit warm waters around the equator and feed on plankton and small fish through a filter-feeding mechanism. Whale sharks are generally slow-moving and are considered gentle giants, often seen swimming close to the surface. They are migratory, moving to different areas in search of food. Unfortunately, whale sharks face threats from human activities, including fishing, habitat destruction, and climate change.
